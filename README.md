# AmazonWebScraper
This python application will scrape through a HTML webpage using Beautiful Soup. This allows us to check a webpage like Amazon, and set the current price. So if the price becomes lower or equal to the price declared it will send an email alert using the smtplib. Navigate to the config.py file to enter these details before use.

# Requirements
Your computer will need to have python 3 installed. You can do this by heading over to https://www.python.org/downloads/

# Instructions
Once python3 is installed you will need to navigate to where the clone downloaded. It will download as a zip file so unzip the file. Once unzipped, navigate to the config.py file and make the necessary changes.

The config.py file has very clear instructions.

Open terminal and change the directory to where the files are in the unzipped folder. You can do this on a MacOS computer like 'cd ./Downloads/AmazonWebScraper' or by clicking and droping the folder into the terminal.

You can now type the command 'python3 app.py' (without the ') into the terminal. 
Enjoy!
