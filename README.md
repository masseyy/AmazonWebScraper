# AmazonWebScraper
This python application will scrape through a HTML webpage using Beautiful Soup. This allows us to check a webpage like Amazon, and set a price. So if the price becomes lower or equal to the price declared it will send an email alert using the smtplib. Navigate to the config.py file to enter these details before use.
